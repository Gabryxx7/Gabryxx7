If you are not a Computer Scientist, as in someone who studied Computer Science (CS) or any related field, chances are you have never heard of these two words.
And even if you did study CS, you might have probably just heard or read about it a few times.

In my case, Italian Universities were and probably still are quite on the theoretical side of things: We did not do that much coding but oh boy did we study all the theory and low level mathematical/logical models of languages and computing.
And in one of these courses called Principles of Programming Languages we actually delved as deep as possible into the way programming languages are made, their fundamentals and how they differentiate from one another.
Among all of these there was one interesting name, Haskell which I eventually kept hearing again often. I did used other functional programming languages in the past such as OCaml, but not many people know of it or has not been used that much from what I have seen.

I then learnt R during my PhD and although it's not a functional programming language, it has some of those features, and same can be said for Python and Java or even Javascript with their lambdas and monads.
