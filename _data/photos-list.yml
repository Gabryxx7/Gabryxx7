      \ the water comes straight from the ocean, you can find all sorts of sea creatures\

    caption: 'More wildlife photos!

      I had never seen a pelican in my life until I came to Australia! These specifically
      are Australian Pelicans and they are some absolute units with a wingspan up to
      2.5m! Good thing these ones don''t hang around trying to steal food like the bin
      chickens or the seagulls. They are not very rare but always a sight when they
      fly by, oh and some of them have blue feet!

    caption: '"Glass" - Early morning, thunders from a far away storm still echo in
      the distance, as I step out of the car the grass shakes off the rain onto my feet,
      it feels good to stretch. The sun is now shining beyond the cliff as the rays
      stab the incessant emerald waves. It''s just another day and yet, it''s not just
      another morning.

    caption: 'Koalas suffer the heat too hey!

      While koalas are not extremely rare in Southeastern Australia, it''s definitely
      not everyday that you see them this close during the day! They sleep up to 18hrs
      a day and almost always on the branches at the top of Eucalyptus trees!

      Some trivia about koalas: Many of them have Chlamydia (not the same strain as
      the human one), they are "smooth brained" so really not the sharpest tool in the
      shed, their teeth have not adapted to their diet and so their teeth will eventually
      ground down which means they won''t be able to eat leaves anymore and will eventually
      starve to death. Koalas is an Aboriginal term that means "no drink" as it was
      initially thought that they do not drink and only get their water from the gumtree
      leaves.

    caption: 'Walking at night in a rainforest surrounded by little blue-ish glowing
      dots is most definitely a magical, esoteric experience!


      Not many people know about them but they can be seen all around Australia and
      NZ: Springrbrook, the Blue Mountains and the notorious Waitomo cave and of course
      the Great Ocean Road!


      Some trivia: Glowworms are bioluminescent larvae of the fungus gnat, a tiny flying
      insect similar to a mosquito but often non-biting and not as annoying! Arachnocampa
      is the name of the gnat genus with a bioluminescent larval stage and they are
      endemic to Australia and New Zealand! The larvae glow to attract preys into its
      threads which you can see in the pics!

    caption: 'The HMVS Cerberus is a breakwater shipwreck resting in Half Moon Bay since
      1926!

      The wreck is actually less than 200m from the shore and lots of swimmers and paddle
      boarders pass by it every day!

      It''s definitely worth a visit, and Half Moon Bay sports some of the most picturesque
      cliffs and waters just 20km from Melbourne''s CBD!

    caption: 'Boxing fight in the oval!

      I don''t know much about Aussie football but this matches what I''ve heard of
      it!

      Male kangaroos often fight to establish dominance, and they use their tails as
      a fifth leg, which is actually extremely strong and can support their whole weight!
      When they are not kicking, their fights are actually rather funny to watch. But
      don''t be fooled, they pack a punch too (see the 4th photo). Seeing that alpha
      roo looking at me, I the same concerned look as the little joey in the last pic!

    caption: 'Freedom! After the longest lockdown in the world and over a year of postponing
      it, we finally went on our whale watching cruise at Wilson''s Prom! The wait was
      more than worth it! A stunning day delighted us with: a baby humpback and its
      mother, some playful short-beaked dolphins and a colony of Australian fur seals!

    caption: 'Forgotten Photos - Part 1

      The worst thing about lockdown is how it absolutely destroys my creativity. I
      took these photos back in April 2021, but I was just never in the mood to edit
      them.

      The milky way doesn''t get any clearer than this! Its core is fully visible between
      March and October (in the southern hemisphere) so April was the perfect time to
      enjoy the view in the Australian outback!

      That green glow is the Aurora Australis!! Despite Mungo being far away from the
      magnetic south pole, the G2 solar storm of April 2021 made it so that the Aurora
      was visible at latitudes far away from the magnetic poles!

      Definitely one of those "once in a lifetime" shots!

      This is an HDR shot of the moon. Two exposures edited in lightroom and then layered
      and merged in photoshop.

    caption: 'Another take at some self-portraits in a very rudimental photography studio.
      It''s also a way to look at this photo and remind myself that I can get in shape
      if I want to!


      Shot on a Sony A7R iii and a 70-200mm g-master at 112mm 1/30s f/4.5, edited the
      RAW file in Lightroom and then removed the backtground in Photoshop and added
      a soft radial gradient instead.


      You can see the "studio" in the last photo, I originally used my bike light and
      stuck it to the wall with some blue tack to get the red light but it was too harsh
      and red, I borrowed this LED bar from the lab and it''s much softer and consistent!

      Will I take fewer risks in 2021? Hell nah.

      But is this an uplifting and inspirational post? Also no.


      You could do everything correctly, be extra cautious, take no risks and shit might
      you like a truck anyways. Might as well enjoy life the way you want it. Some years

    caption: 'Jodhpur''s stepwell! Not sure why but these wells fascinate me, they are
      quite deeper than you might think but getting down is not as scary and water is
      surprisingly clean considering how heavily polluted any other water source is.

    caption: 'Puhskar and its sacred lake. Just like in the temples, shoes are off limits
      pretty much all around the lake and the city but that did not stop us from walking
      around and watching the sunset while the aarti ritual started. It borders the
      Thar Desert, and with camels, bazars, rituals, temples, wonderful people and peculiar
      food, I can see why it''s a pilgrimage stop for many.

      Sorry for the spam btw, but the sights are just too much!

    caption: 'I was extremely lucky to spot this elusive, weird and fascinating creature!
      Platypuses are natives of Australia and although not threatened, they are not
      easy to spot and are extremely shy! I was so excited to see one that this was
      the best pic I got (very much zoomed in, that''s what 40mpx are for!) and by the
      time I climbed down to the river it was already gone!


      A little trivia: Platypuses and Echidnas are the only egg-laying mammals and belong
      to the order of the monotremes. The other two orders of mammals being marsupials
      (such as kangaroos and koalas) and placental (all the other non-weird mammals
      we all know)

    caption: '31/08/2019 Aurora Australis/Southern Lights! Been chasing it for a while
      now. Contrary to their cousins in the North, the Southern Lights are quite rare
      to catch a glimpse of. They can be seen from Southern Tasmania and New Zealand
      and only during strong geo magnetic storms (KP > 4). To the naked eye they are
      not as colorful as in the picture but the shapes and the river of lights is well
      visible and breathtaking nonetheless!
