      As the sun rays hit the cold, wet trunks and leaves, steam pervaded the air as the rainforest breathed as one.

     The iconic Princess Pier at Port Melbourne. Sometimes you swim in these cold waters, other times you are just shooting it from the dryland, can't tell which one I enjoy the most!

      The Alpine region of Victoria, Australia is a gorgeous hidden gem. Gumtrees full of snow, Alpine dingoes, wallabies, and a breathtaking landscape of snowy peaks and forests. It's not the European Alps or the Canadian mountains, but it's worth the hike nonetheless!

     It was cold but the sun was burning, and I was all sweaty as well, hence the short sleeves!

     Another drone shot from Wilson's Prom's Jan 2019 hike! I had never noticed the little Ray in the water at the bottom left of the pic! Truly a stunning place, that 27km hike was ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!

     Jodhpur, the blue city! A good mix between a more modern city and an older, historical one. Unfortunately I got the flu on the way to Jodhpur so I think I did not enjoy as much as I could, but it was beautiful nonetheless. Now off to some warmth!

     Jodhpur's stepwell! Not sure why but these wells fascinate me, they are quite deeper than you might think but getting down is not as scary and water is surprisingly clean considering how heavily polluted any other water source is.

     Puhskar and its sacred lake. Just like in the temples, shoes are off limits pretty much all around the lake and the city but that did not stop us from walking around and watching the sunset while the aarti ritual started. It borders the Thar Desert, and with camels, bazars, rituals, temples, wonderful people and peculiar food, I can see why it's a pilgrimage stop for many.
     Sorry for the spam btw, but the sights are just too much!

     Unfortunately, protests are hapoening all over the city and many sights of Delhi are blocked or not safe. We still managed to see something and the architecture so far is absolutely beautiful despite the pollution and the fog. And this is nothing but the beginning of our trip! I have been told multiple times that better landscapes are awaiting us in UP and Rajasthan 😁

     I have visited quite a few Asian countries by now but I swear there is nothing quite like India, and I was prepared to the shock. Delhi was the first stop and traffic was straight up fascinating, honks are still echoing in my head. No rules on the street and still, somehow, not an accident, just amazing. I am in love with these little streets full of life and well, cables. Definitely an experience!

     I was extremely lucky to spot this elusive, weird and fascinating creature! Platypuses are natives of Australia and although not threatened, they are not easy to spot and are extremely shy! I was so excited to see one that this was the best pic I got (very much zoomed in, that's what 40mpx are for!) and by the time I climbed down to the river it was already gone!
     
     A little trivia: Platypuses and Echidnas are the only egg-laying mammals and belong to the order of the monotremes. The other two orders of mammals being marsupials (such as kangaroos and koalas) and placental (all the other non-weird mammals we all know)

     31/08/2019 Aurora Australis/Southern Lights! Been chasing it for a while now. Contrary to their cousins in the North, the Southern Lights are quite rare to catch a glimpse of. They can be seen from Southern Tasmania and New Zealand and only during strong geo magnetic storms (KP > 4). To the naked eye they are not as colorful as in the picture but the shapes and the river of lights is well visible and breathtaking nonetheless!

     The tarsier is one of the smallest known primates that only lives in some island of the South East Asia. It's nocturnal but you can pay it a daily visit at the Loboc sanctuary! With those big eyes can either be extremely cute or intimidating, especially when slowly rotating its little head 180° when woken up from its naps! #tarsier #bohol #philippines
