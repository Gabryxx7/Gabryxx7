    Gabriele is currently a PhD Candidate in Computing and Information System at the University of Melbourne, Australia.
    He is passionate about all kinds of technology but his focus is currently on Ubiquitous Computing, IoT and HCI. In the non-existent
    free time he enjoys some landscape photography, swimming in the ocean all year long and seeing as many kangaroos as possible.
